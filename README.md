# EDA_Gender_Prediction

In that repo I presente to you a presentation with 3 slides showing the dataset and insights dedicated to non technical teams (Sale Team, Marketing team, ..). The main goal of that presentation is to demonstrate the importance of a data analysis part in the process of data science. 
I tried to tell story througth the data, starting with some assumptions that resonate with my audiance and at the end have a clear answers and insights. In addition, those insights can be useful for the predicting phase.

In the notebook enclosed, i splitted my work into 3 phases:
1. EDA : analyse the data with keeping in mind my assumpations I want to verify and questions I came up as I go along. While trying highlighting some behavior, it is common to create new variables, in fact I m used to do some features engineering during my EDA.
2. Gender Prediction : Following the EDA, I decided to predict the gender. Since the data is imbalanced, it is interesting to evaluate the model performance according a businnesswise objectif.
3. Model Limitation Study : How can we improve the model if a mistake in classifying male is equal to five mistakes in classifying females knowing that classifying male correctly is more important than classifying females correctly. It is the question I answer.

In that porject, I don't try to have the best model, but I try to figure out if the model is suitable for the purpose of the company (company that doesn't exist that let s imagine it is). I use several metric to evaluate the model and explain for each of them why it can be interesting to use it.
